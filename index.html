                <h2>AJEBAH’S ANGOLAN PARTNERS HAVE WON THE 1ST PRIZE</h2>
                <h5>IN DIGITAL STARTUP COMPETITION</h5>
                <p>The South-African Nation of Angola is where we found our client a while back. These self-motivated and hard-working Angolan Entrepreneurs were ideating and trying to finalise 
                  what service to offer and build their business on.
                </p>
                <p>This is where V3Cube makes a classic entrance and woo them with their Apps to the 
                  extent that they are swept off of their feet. They bought a fully-functional and market-tested 
                  app from us and started running their business in their hometown in Angola. They allowed their 
                  App Users to pay in their official currency Kwanza and browse content in Portuguese. Their App 
                  became a household name in a matter of weeks’ time and they were doing well from the App Launch 
                  date itself. This is when they participated in their country’s biggest start-up competition and 
                  they undisputedly won the first prize.
                </p>
                <p>We had rebranded our base app with their company’s name and logo and even changed their entire 
                  app’s colour theme to match with the colour of the company’s logo. We are so proud of our Angolan 
                  Clients for their success and achievements and feel grateful that we could be a part of it. This 
                  again is a living proof that we are the industry stalwarts and are the pioneers of futuristic 
                  clone app development business.

                  delivering excellent solutions to our clients, we also understand that all 
                  work and no play makes jack a dull boy. Since we are an offshore company 
                  working with clients from all over the world, we take every opportunity of 
                  meeting with clients to create fond memories that can help us cherish them forever. T
                  ake a look at some of the scintillating pictures from our recent adventures 
                  with our clients. Here we have our client from Nairobi, Kenya who visited 
                  us for his Gojek clone development requirements. Over a cup of tea and a general 
                  discussion we found out that his
                </p>
                <h2>MOST LOVED SPORT WAS GOLF.</h2>
                <p>Our manager turned every stone to make his trip to India a memorable one by 
                  taking him to the COUNTRY’S LARGEST GOLF COURSE to play a game or two followed 
                  by a generous supper. His smile at the end of the day was a great prize for us. 
                  So, if you are planning to visit us in Ahmedabad to discuss your projects, rest 
                  assured we will do everything to see a <span>BRIGHT SMILE ON YOUR FACE.</span>
                </p>
                <p>Outings and adventures are just one part of our work culture. Take a look at 
                  Archivaldo, our client from Chile who visited us for his own App development 
                  requirements. He is a patron of GOOD MUSIC and happened to tell us about his 
                  fondness of guitars. We arranged for a quick little concert in office for him 
                  where he got the stage to himself. He played some wonderful soulful songs by his 
                  FAVORITE ARTISTS, CAT STEVENS AND BEATLES FOR US. The whole office was murmuring 
                  with fervour and was totally refuelled with energy to work significantly more 
                  earnestly for every one of the clients. Many thanks ARCHIVALDO! <span>WE LOVED YOUR 
                    SINGING AND CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE YOU BACK.</span>
